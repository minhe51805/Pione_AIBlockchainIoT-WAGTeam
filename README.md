# Pione_AIBlockchainIoT-WAGTeam
Pione_AIBlockchainIoT-WAGTeam links an ESP32 and 7-in-1 soil sensor to a backend that cleans and standardizes data, then splits: (1) curated datasets train ML models for irrigation, nutrition, and health forecasts; (2) the same records are hashed and anchored on Pione’s blockchain. APIs and a dashboard deliver live metrics and provenance checks v2.
